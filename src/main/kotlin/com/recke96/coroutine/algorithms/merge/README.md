# Merge algorithms

This is the sub program `merge`.
Additional options are `-n NUM` for size of input 1,
`-m NUM` for size of input 2,
`-p NUM` for number of processes used by algorithm which use this number to divide the work.

## Sequential

A simple sequential implementation is in `Sequential.kt`.
