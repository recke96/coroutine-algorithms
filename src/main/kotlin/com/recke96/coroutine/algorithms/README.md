# Parallel Algorithms in Kotlin

In this repository I try and benchmark different algorithms in parallel and sequential.

Currently there are:
* Merge algorithms, start with `merge`.

-------

The program needs to be started with arguments.
The first positional argument is the "sub"-program to run which corresponds to a category of algorithms.
Currently there is only the sub program `merge`.
Each sub program may need additional arguments.
